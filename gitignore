# -----------------------------------------------
# Generic .gitignore for LaTeX Projects
# Compiler: pdflatex
# Goal: Keep source files AND the final .pdf
# -----------------------------------------------

# --- 1. Compiler Output Files (IGNORE) ---
# These are generated every time you compile and should not be tracked.
*.aux         # Auxiliary file: Stores cross-reference information.
*.bbl         # BibTeX output file (temporary bibliography).
*.blg         # BibTeX log file.
*.lof         # List of figures.
*.lot         # List of tables.
*.log         # Compiler log file (often large and verbose).
*.toc         # Table of contents file.
*.nav         # Navigation file (used by beamer for structure).
*.snm         # Beamer output file.
*.out         # General output file for various things (often PDF metadata).
*.dvi         # Device independent file (used by older compilers or conversion tools).
*.synctex.gz  # SyncTeX file (used for forward/inverse search between PDF and source).
*.fls         # File list generated by the compiler.
*.fdb_latexmk # File database generated by latexmk.
*.idx         # Index file.
*.ilg         # Index log file.
*.ind         # Index output file.
*.ist         # Index style file.
*.gz          # Compressed files (often generated from sync files).
*.xdv         # Extended DVI (used by XeTeX).

# --- 2. Editor and Backup Files (IGNORE) ---
# Files generated by common editors and OS environments.
*~            # Emacs backup files.
\#* # Generic temporary/lock files (e.g., created by vim).
.\#* # Generic temporary/lock files (e.g., created by vim).
*.bak         # General backup files.
.DS_Store     # macOS Finder temporary file.
Thumbs.db     # Windows thumbnail cache.

# --- 3. Bibliography-Specific Files (IGNORE) ---
# Generated by Biber or BibTeX
*-blx.bib     # Biber/BibLaTeX auxiliary files.
*.run.xml     # XML files used by some tools (e.g., biblatex).
*.bcf         # Biber control file.

# --- 4. EXCEPTION: Keep the PDF ---
# The primary PDF output is usually named the same as the main .tex file.
# We DO NOT ignore *.pdf. If your project uses a generic Makefile that
# creates a different name, adjust the next line:
# Example: If your main file is 'report.tex', it produces 'report.pdf'.

# By leaving *.pdf uncommented, your final compiled document will be tracked.
# If you use temporary PDFs for testing, you may need a more complex rule.
# Example: If you only want to keep 'final.pdf' but ignore others:
# !final.pdf
# *.pdf
